👋 Hi, I’m @mapother

🔭 I’m currently working on a voice-guided, AI driven golf caddy robot, as well as a MR immersive historical battlefield experience.
👀 I’m interested in AI, LLM, NLP, and anything related to any of the NASA/JPL Mars projects.
🌱 I’m currently learning NVIDA’s approach to creating deep learning models.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most anything driven by Python, NLP AI projects, voice-guided robotics, and spatial computing, chatbots et al.
📫 I can be reached at skerrnyc@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: I’ve been called most anything imaginable, some of it was true…
⚡ Fun fact: I was once the lead singer and bass player for a post-punk/new wave band, 
became a trader at a global investment bank as the world darn near collapsed leading up to 2008, 
and eventually worked as a project manager on an AI software project for the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
I still want to be in a band…
